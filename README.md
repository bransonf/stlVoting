# stlVoting
This repository will contain machine-readable, Saint Louis precinct-level data for the 2016 presidential election. It will also contain the R code used to produce spatial data.

Note that the only data in this repository currently is for total voter turnout in Saint Louis. The data were cleaned by hand, and verified. The raw data is more rich, but difficult to convert to something machine readable.
